00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,345
Hi there!

2
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:12,935
I'm your learning consultant, here to help you choose
the right training modality for your next project.Whether

3
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:19,015
you're building a quick reference guide, a full eLearning
course, or a hands-on workshop, the right format depends

4
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:20,452
on a few key factors.

5
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,088
Let's explore them together.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,027
First, consider your audience size.

7
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:30,417
If your training is meant for a small group — say,
under 25 people — live or instructor-led sessions

8
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:31,688
can be very effective.

9
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:34,660
You'll have more opportunity for discussion and coaching.

10
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:41,945
But when you're training hundreds or even thousands
of employees, scalable options like eLearning modules

11
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,747
or video tutorials make much more sense.

12
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:48,287
They ensure everyone gets the same message, wherever
they are.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,713
Next, think about your budget and available resources.

14
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:57,383
If you're working with a tight timeline or limited
funds, a well-designed job aid or quick reference

15
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:58,817
guide might be your best option.

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:05,367
When you have a moderate budget, consider an eLearning
course — it offers interactivity and can be reused

17
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,107
many times.

18
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:11,857
And if you have the time and funding, you might combine
formats — for example, a polished video paired with

19
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:13,978
short learning activities for reinforcement.

20
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,940
The nature of your content also plays a big role.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,698
If you're simply sharing information or raising awareness,
a short video or microlearning module can do the job.

22
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:29,528
If you need to teach a process or build a skill,
interactive eLearning or simulations help learners

23
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:30,489
practice safely.

24
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:36,323
And for performance support — something learners use
on the job — job aids or quick guides are ideal.

25
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:42,252
When you put all these factors together — audience
size, budget, and content type — you can identify

26
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:44,854
the modality that gives your learners the most value.

27
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:50,364
There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but aligning
these three elements helps you make smart, strategic

28
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:52,179
training choices every time.

29
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:56,670
So the next time you're planning a training project,
take a quick consultative approach.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,318
Ask yourself: Who's learning?

31
00:01:58,468 --> 00:01:59,188
What's the goal?

32
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:00,789
And what resources do I have?

33
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,457
The right answers will naturally point you toward
the best training modality.

34
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:10,227
Thanks for joining me for this micro-consulting session —
and here's to designing learning experiences that

35
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,626
truly make an impact!
